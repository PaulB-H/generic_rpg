# Generic RPG

<p>The start of my single player mostly text-based RPG</p>
<p>I am starting off by figuring out how to get the animations working, and will build the combat system after. I am not experienced with animations in CSS or JS, so this will be a good learning experience for me</p>
<p>To get the animations working, I started by cutting the sections out of the main spritesheet, and saving the strip as one file.</p>
